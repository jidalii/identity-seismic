## Intro

### Problem

The lack of a reliable platform for conducting retail business with customers in a decentralized manner makes merchants hesitant about the Web3 world. For these businesses, there is an urgent need for an easy-to-use, ready-to-deploy platform that allows them to transition their operations on-chain.

### Insights

Seismic’s encrypted network provides a trustworthy platform for merchants to conduct their business with customers in a manner. Privacy and verifiability work to allow merchants and customers to interact with each other with confidence.

### Solution

Our on-chain identity protocol aggregates and verifies user data (both off-chain and on-chain) using ZKPs, enabling merchants to start their businesses, create customizable reward systems, and securely interact with customers in a decentralized environment.
